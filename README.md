# Rover32

**Rover32** is a compact, motorized robot controlled by an ESP32 using WebSocket technology. It allows for real-time remote control via a web-based interface, enabling smooth and responsive movement.

## Features

- **ESP32 Control**: Uses an ESP32 microcontroller to handle commands and motor control.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Enables low-latency, real-time control over Wi-Fi.
- **Web-based Interface**: Control the robot from any device with a browser.
- **Easy to Customize**: Add sensors, modify movement settings, or expand functionality with additional components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller, motor driver, chassis with motors, and optional sensors.
- **Software**: Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support, WebSocket library.

### Installation

1. **Set up** the ESP32 with your Arduino IDE.
2. **Upload** the code to your ESP32.
3. Connect to the robot’s Wi-Fi and open the web interface to start controlling Rover32.

## Usage

Connect to Rover32’s Wi-Fi network, open the provided web interface in a browser, and control the robot using on-screen buttons or a joystick.
