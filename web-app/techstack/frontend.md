[React (v19.0.0)](https://react.dev/)

React is the UI library that powers the interactive components. It uses a component-based architecture where UI elements are modular and reusable. This architecture was released at least a year ago and today is the best way to render a page.

[**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript adds static type-checking to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer experience:

* Type safety: Catches errors during development rather than runtime
* Better IDE support: Intelligent code completion and documentation
* Easier refactoring: Types make large-scale changes safer

[_Tailwind CSS (v4)_](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows styling directly in markup:

* Rapid development: Pre-defined utility classes speed up UI implementation
* Consistency: Standardized design tokens for spacing, colors, etc.
* Responsive design: Built-in responsive utilities
* Minimal CSS output: Only includes used styles

**UI Component Libraries**
